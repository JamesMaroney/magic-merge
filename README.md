# MagicMerge

Basic "mail-merge" type tool with spreadsheets and rich text strings.<br/>
This tool allows you to use a simple Rich Text Editor to apply a formatted template to each row of a spreadsheet and capture the output to your clipboard.

[Try it here](https://jamesmaroney.github.io/magic-merge/)

Note: no personal data is sent from your browser. The spreadsheet is not uploaded to any server, it is kept in your browser, on your computer at all times.<br />
Feel free to use this tool. If you find it useful, let me know by starring the repo.
