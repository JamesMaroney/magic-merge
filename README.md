# MagicMerge

Basic "mail-merge" type tool with spreadsheets and rich text strings.<br/>
This tool allows you to use a simple Rich Text Editor to apply a formatted template to each row of a spreadsheet and capture the output to your clipboard.

[Try it here](https://jamesmaroney.github.io/magic-merge/)

Note: no personal data is sent from your browser. The spreadsheet is not uploaded to any server, it is kept in your browser, on your computer at all times.<br />
Feel free to use this tool. If you find it useful, let me know by starring the repo.

# How to Use
1. Load your source spreadsheet
2. Create your template.
   * You can use the rich text features to bold, italicize or underline your template text.
   * You can use the toolbar buttons or right-click context menu to add fields from your spreadsheet, conditionals, and other selected functions.
3. The Output panel will update as you make your changes. Use the "copy to clipboard" button when you are ready to put the generated text into your target document.

If you'd like to request any features, I may be able to add them. You can do so [here in the Github Issues](https://github.com/JamesMaroney/magic-merge/issues).
